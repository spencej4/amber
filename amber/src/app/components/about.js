                        Amber is a creative and playful nanny who just recently moved to 
                        Seattle from the east coast. In her free-time, Amber enjoys hiking, 
                        exploring her new surroundings, and reading. Growing up in a large 
                        family encouraged Amber to become the outgoing and dedicated nanny 
                        that she is today. Amberâ€™s top priority is helping children learn and 
                        grow in a safe and nurturing environment.
